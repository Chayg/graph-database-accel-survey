\section{Accelerating the Index Traversals for In-Memory Databases}
This work \cite{kocberber2013meet} developed an hardware accelerator for hash index lookup which is a
critical operation for database query. The accelerator was built on top of a RISC
processor architecture. It shares the cache hierarchy and closely coupled with a
host processor. Here are the highlights of this accelerator.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The index operation is divided into three steps i.e. hash, walk
        traversal and result output. Particularly, hash and walk traversal are
        decoupled using a set of queues. Eventually, the two operations are
        pipelined. 
    \item This work allows multiple index operations performed in parallel on
        the same hash table. Moreover, as the parallel walk traversals typically
        occurs on different rows of the hash table. These keys can fit in the
        same cache line thanks to the hash logic, which is also a key factor for
        the final good performance.
    \item The accelerator is built based on a RISC processor architecture. There
        are a few interesting design optimizations here.
        \subitem The touch instruction is developed to pre-fetch the data blocks
        to reduce the long memory access overhead.
        \subitem Input buffers and output buffers are nicely integrated in the
        processor pipeline to decouple the hash and walk traversal operations.
        \subitem A few three-operand operations are added to aid the hash
        operations.
\end{itemize}

Although the authors claimed that this work handles the pointer chasing based
node traversal during the indexing, no optimization is actually done for this.
When the node traversal of an entry of a hash table starts, it sequentially does
the chasing. The system achieves the performance mainly through the multiple
parallel traversals and balanced hashing.

There are few design options that may be further optimized.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The host processor will be idled when the accelerator starts to work.
    \item The host processor does the index work when there are exceptions such
        as TLB miss. It seems that accelerator will be used only when the data
        set is in the main memory.
    \item As the cache line is typically determined, the number of the parallel keys and
        the size of the keys will be limited when fitting the multiple parallel
        keys in the same cache line.
\end{itemize}
