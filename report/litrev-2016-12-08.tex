\section{MapGraph}
This work \cite{fu2014mapgraph} is a GPU graph processing framework based on GAS model.
The major contribution is a combined load balancing strategy. By taking the size of
the frontier as the metric, MapGraph can choose either a dynamic scheduling
based balancing or a two-step balancing strategy.
