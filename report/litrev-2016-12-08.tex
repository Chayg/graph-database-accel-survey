\section{MapGraph}
This work \cite{fu2014mapgraph} is a GPU graph processing framework based on GAS model.
The major contribution is a combined load balancing strategy. By taking the size of
the frontier as the metric, MapGraph can choose either a dynamic scheduling
based balancing or a two-step balancing strategy.

\section{Energy Efficient Scalable SpMV on FPGAs}
This work \cite{dorrance2014scalable} developed a sparse matrix-vector multiplication computing engine. It
can make good use of the CSC compression format of the sparse data and allows
stream processing of the input data. The basic idea is rather simple. Instead of
performing the vector dot production for the matrix-vector computing, it take
the computing as a weighted vector addition. This is particularly beneficial
because of the sequential memory access. According to the experiments on ROACH,
the design exhibits great performance speedup with higher bandwidth though.
