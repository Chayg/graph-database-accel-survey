\section{Dynamic Graph Processing}
Problems of processing dynamic graph with its continuous updates in real-time manner
\begin{itemize}
\item Graph storage: Modification of graph structure is costly
\item Fast response: Widely used global manner cannot achieve real-time processing
\item Workload imbalance: Some vertices update more frequently and consume more computing resource in a certain period of time.
\end{itemize}

Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Random-access graph structure: Hash-based graph partition strategy to enable fine-grained graph updates
\item Incremental graph processing: Vertex-based incremental graph computing model
\item Workload rebalance: Detect hotspots and evaluate their workload, and then rebalance them with greedy algorithms.
\end{itemize}
